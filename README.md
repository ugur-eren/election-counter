# Election Counter

This app is designed for vote counting at ballot stations by voters for the upcoming Turkey elections. It is not intended to be used in any other election hopefully..

Tech stack is just a simple React Native w/ Expo app with Redux for state management. That's it, it's just a single page app.

State is persisted so you can close the app and open it again and continue counting.

## Expo Snack

You can try the app on your phone with Expo Snack. Just open the link below and scan the QR code with Expo app.

> However, snack currently only supports SDK 47, so it's not up to date with the repo. For example, the new flex gap feature in React Native is not supported on Expo Snack. I'll update it when it's possible.
